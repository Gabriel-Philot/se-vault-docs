# Research Prompt: Advanced Software Engineering Topics for Data Engineers

## Context

I am a data engineer working to become a more mature software engineer to effectively handle MLOps, LLMOps, and modern data engineering challenges. I have already studied foundational software engineering concepts including:

- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** Classes, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction
- **Memory Management:** Stack vs. heap, Python memory allocation, reference counting, and garbage collection
- **Best Practices:** Memory optimization, common pitfalls (memory leaks, dangling pointers, buffer overflows), and debugging tools (Valgrind, AddressSanitizer)
- **Design Patterns:** Basic architectural patterns applied to data engineering contexts

## Research Objective

Please research and identify **advanced software engineering topics** that would be valuable for a data engineer to master, with a focus on:

1. **Python-specific topics** such as:
   - Building production-grade REST APIs (FastAPI, Flask design patterns)
   - Dependency injection and service containers
   - Configuration management and environment handling
   - Logging, monitoring, and observability patterns

2. **MLOps and LLMOps topics** including:
   - Model versioning and experiment tracking
   - Feature stores and data versioning
   - Model serving architectures (batch vs. real-time)
   - CI/CD for machine learning pipelines
   - A/B testing and model evaluation in production
   - LLM-specific challenges (prompt management, vector databases, RAG patterns)

3. **Data engineering architecture topics**:
   - Event-driven architectures (Kafka, pub/sub patterns)
   - Data contracts and schema evolution
   - Orchestration patterns beyond basic DAGs
   - Microservices for data platforms
   - API gateway patterns for data services
   - Stream processing architectures

4. **Software quality and reliability**:
   - Code review best practices
   - Performance profiling and optimization
   - Error handling and resilience patterns
   - Documentation strategies (API docs, architecture decision records)
   - Security best practices (secrets management, authentication/authorization)

## Deliverable Requirements

For each topic identified:

1. **Topic name and brief description**
2. **Why it's important** for a data engineer working with MLOps/LLMOps
3. **Prerequisites** (what foundational knowledge is needed)
4. **Practical applications** in real-world data engineering scenarios
5. **Learning resources** (official documentation, tutorials, courses)
6. **Difficulty level** (intermediate, advanced, expert)

## Priority Areas

Please prioritize topics that:

- Are **directly applicable** to building production data/ML systems
- Bridge the gap between **data engineering and software engineering**
- Are **commonly used** in modern data platforms (2025-2026)
- Help prevent **common mistakes** made by engineers transitioning from data to software focus
- Enable building **scalable, maintainable, and reliable** systems

## Format

Organize the research by category, and provide specific, actionable topics rather than broad areas. For example, instead of "API development," specify "FastAPI dependency injection patterns for database connections" or "Implementing graceful shutdown in Python web servers."

**Note:** This research will guide the creation of educational materials similar to the existing OOP and memory management documents in the `funda-re` folder, so prioritize topics that can be explained with practical code examples and data engineering analogies.
